    "There are several possible ways of parameterizing Q using a neural network. Since Q maps history-action pairs to scalar estimates of their Q-value, the history and the action have been used as inputs to the neural network by some previous approaches [20, 12]. The main drawback of this type of architecture is that a separate forward pass is required to compute the Q-value of each action, resulting in a cost that scales linearly with the number of actions. We instead use an architecture in which there is a separate output unit for each possible action, and only the state representation is an input to the neural network. The outputs correspond to the predicted Q-values of the individual action for the input state. The main advantage of this type of architecture is the ability to compute Q-values for all possible actions in a given state with only a single forward pass through the network.\n",

    "frames, and fixed at 0.1 thereafter. We trained for a total of 10 million frames and used a replay\n",
    "memory of one million most recent frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following previous approaches to playing Atari games, we also use a simple frame-skipping technique [3]. More precisely, the agent sees and selects actions on every kth frame instead of every frame, and its last action is repeated on skipped frames. Since running the emulator forward for one step requires much less computation than having the agent select an action, this technique allows the agent to play roughly k times more games without significantly increasing the runtime. We use k = 4 for all games except Space Invaders where we noticed that using k = 4 makes the lasers invisible because of the period at which they blink. We used k = 3 to make the lasers visible and this change was the only difference in hyperparameter values between any of the games."
