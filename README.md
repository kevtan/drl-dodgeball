# DRL Dodgeball
DRL (Deep Reinforcement Learning) has led to the creation of agents that exhibit fascinatingly complex and intelligent behavior, especially in the area of computer games like [Dota 2](https://openai.com/blog/dota-2/) and [StarCraft II](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.04782.pdf). An exciting area of research for is to develop digital agents that eventually get deployed into physical robots, a task which OpenAIâ€™s [Dactyl project](https://openai.com/blog/learning-dexterity/) demonstrates requires high-fidelity training environments. In this project, we designed a physically realistic simulation with high-dimensional sensory data sources, and trained an agent using a refined deep Q-network in it.

## Future Work
- Accomodate continuous action spaces
- Acommodate multi-dimensional action spaces
- Accomodate visual observations (first-person and birds-eye)
- Experiment with more robust neural network architectures
- Experiment with different optimizers
